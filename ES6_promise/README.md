ES6 Promises 🚀
Welcome to the ES6 Promises project. In this repository, we'll explore the power and flexibility of promises in JavaScript, introduced in ES6. 🌟

Introduction 🌍
Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. They allow working with asynchronous code in a clearer and more readable way, avoiding the dreaded "callback hell". 🕳️

Key Concepts 🔑
Promise States: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected 🌊
then, resolve, catch: Key methods for handling promises 🔧
await: Operator for waiting for the resolution of promises within async functions 🕰️
async: Functions that return promises and allow using await 🚀

Promise Methods 📚
Promise.all(): Waits for all promises to resolve 🌐
Promise.allSettled(): Waits for all promises to resolve or reject 🌍
Promise.any(): Waits for one promise to resolve and returns its value 🔍
Promise.race(): Waits for any promise to resolve or reject 🏁
Promise.reject(): Creates a rejected promise with a specific reason 🚫
Promise.resolve(): Creates a resolved promise with a specific value 👍

Goals 🎯
Understand the basics of promises in JavaScript
Learn to use promise methods to handle asynchronous operations
Master the use of then, resolve, catch, and await to write clear and readable asynchronous code
Learn to use Promise.all(), Promise.allSettled(), Promise.any(), Promise.race(), Promise.reject(), and Promise.resolve() to handle different promise scenarios
