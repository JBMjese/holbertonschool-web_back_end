# 📊 ES6 Data Manipulation

Welcome to **ES6 Data Manipulation**. This project is designed to teach you how to use the powerful ES6 tools to efficiently manipulate data in JavaScript. We'll learn how to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays, Typed Arrays, as well as the `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures. Let's get started! 🚀

## Contents

- **Using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays**
    - 🔄 `map`: Transform each element of an array using a specified function.
    - 🔍 `filter`: Create a new array containing only elements that meet a specific condition defined by a function.
    - ➕ `reduce`: Accumulate elements of an array into a single value by applying a function to an accumulator and each value in the array sequentially.

- **Typed Arrays (Arrays Tipados)**
    - 🔠 Efficiently handle and operate on raw binary data. Designed to work with data in binary format such as image buffers or network data.

- **`Set`**
    - 🗂️ A collection of unique values. Useful for storing unique data without duplicates. Provides methods to add, delete, and check for the existence of elements, as well as for iterating over its values.

- **`Map`**
    - 🗺️ A collection of key-value pairs, where keys can be of any type including objects and functions. Useful for associating data with specific keys and allows iteration over its elements in the order they were inserted. Provides methods to set, get, delete, and check for the existence of key-value pairs.

- **`WeakMap`**
    - 🕸️ Similar to `Map`, but keys must be objects and references to keys are "weak". Objects referenced as keys can be garbage collected when there are no other references to them. Useful for storing private data associated with objects without preventing them from being garbage collected when no longer needed.
