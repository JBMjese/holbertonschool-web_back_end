Allows paginating a dataset using simple page and page size parameters. This makes it easy to navigate through large datasets by dividing them into manageable pages.

## Hypermedia Metadata Pagination 🌐

Offers the ability to paginate a dataset using hypermedia metadata, enabling more dynamic and information-rich navigation about the complete dataset.

## Deletion-Resilient Pagination 🔒

Implements a pagination strategy that is resilient to deletions of elements from the dataset during pagination process. This ensures a consistent user experience even when underlying data changes.
