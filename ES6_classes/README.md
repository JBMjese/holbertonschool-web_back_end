# ðŸ“š ES6 Classes Project

Welcome to my ES6 project! Here we explore the definition and use of classes in ES6 JavaScript, including methods, static methods, inheritance, and metaprogramming. ðŸš€

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

With this project, you are expected to learn how to:

1. **Define Classes**:
   - Understand the basic syntax and structure of a class in ES6.
   - Create a constructor to initialize instance properties.

2. **Create and Use Methods**:
   - Add instance methods that operate on the object's properties.
   - Implement methods that manipulate and return instance information.

3. **Implement Static Methods**:
   - Define static methods that do not depend on specific instances.
   - Understand the use of `static` and when it is appropriate to use it.

4. **Extend Classes (Inheritance)**:
   - Create subclasses using the `extends` keyword.
   - Override methods in subclasses to modify or extend the functionality of the base class.
   - Use `super` to call the constructor and methods of the parent class.

5. **Apply Metaprogramming**:
   - Use `Proxy` to intercept and redefine fundamental operations on objects.
   - Employ `Symbol` to create unique identifiers and avoid property conflicts.

6. **Improve Code Organization**:
   - Logically group related functionalities within classes.
   - Reuse code effectively through inheritance and subclass creation.

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸš€
